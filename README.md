# Learning-Through-Building-My-Recent-Python-Mini-Projects
mini projects on python 

Over the past week, I’ve been diving deeper into Python by working on a set of small but practical projects to sharpen my problem-solving and coding skills. Here's what I've been up to:

💰 Daily Expense Tracker
I built a simple program that helps track daily expenses over a week. It stores data in a list and provides insights like total spending, average daily expenses, and highlights the highest and lowest spends. A great exercise in data handling and basic analytics!

📇 Contact Book Manager
I created a contact management system using dictionaries, allowing users to add, search, and delete contacts by name. This helped me understand how to work with key-value pairs efficiently and practice implementing user-friendly functionality.

🌡️ Temperature Categorizer
This tool takes a list of temperatures in Celsius and classifies each one as "Cold", "Warm", or "Hot" based on the value. A simple yet effective way to reinforce conditional logic and looping through data structures.

Each project helped me get more comfortable with Python's core concepts and strengthened my understanding of how to apply them to solve everyday problems. 💡

I’m excited to keep building and learning more along the way. If you have any project ideas or feedback, I’d love to connect and collaborate!
